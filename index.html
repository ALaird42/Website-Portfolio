            <div class = "item"><h2>About Me</h2></div>
            <div class = "item"><p>I graduated from the University of Illinois U-C in 2017, with a degree in Music Education. I taught classroom music during the 2017-2018 school year. Since then I have bounced around to many areas of the classical music industry, including musical instrument repair, retail, and teaching private lessons (which I still do).
              I find the tailoring of my teaching to an individual student to be fun, rewarding, and a better application of my skills as an educator.
            </p>
            
              <p>I decided to make the change into software during the COVID-19 pandemic when the entertainment industry was hit particularly hard by the lockdowns and social distancing restrictions. While I still love and enjoy musical performance and teaching, I decided to move away from it as a career, and into something more stable, engaging, and fulfilling.
                I believe working with code will give me the changes I am looking for, while still presenting fun and exciting new challenges and opportunities for personal growth.</p> 

              <p> I enjoy working as a part of a team and getting to flex my creative muscles. I love to dig in and apply my creative problem-solving skills to hunt down and squash JavaScript logic bugs on the back end or pull out my musically honed perfectionism to tweak layouts on the front end. 
                Being a team player, supporting my colleagues, and feeling like I've made a positive impact is what makes me love and thrive in a gig, whether it involves instruments or not!</p>
            
            </div>

            <div class = "item"><p>Outside of work and teaching, I like to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Spend time with family and friends</li>
                <li>Watch movies (mostly action and comedy)</li>
                <li>Play video games</li>
                <li>3D print ridiculous props and goofy things</li>
