          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I graduated from the University of Illinois U-C in 2017, with a degree in Music Education. I taught classroom music during the 2017-2018 school year. Since then I have bounced around to many areas of the classical music industry, incuding musical instrument repair, retail, and teaching private lessons.</p>
          
          <p>I decided to make the change into software during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the entertainment industry was hit particularly hard by the lockdowns and social distancing restrictions. While I still love and enjoy musical preformance and teaching, I decded to move away from it as a career, and into something more stable, engaging, and fufulling.</p> 

          <p> I really enjoy working as a part of a team and getting to flex my creatice muscles. Software development seemed like a no brainer for both of those!</p>

          <p>Outside of work and teaching, I like to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spend time with family and friends</li>
            <li>Watch movies (mostly action and comedy)</li>
            <li>Play videogames</li>
            <li>3D print rediculous props and goofy things</li>
          </ul>
